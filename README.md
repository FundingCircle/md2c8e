# md2c8e

md2c8e — “Markdown to Confluence” — is a tool for publishing sets of [Markdown][markdown] documents
to [Confluence][confluence].


## Status

This tool is in very early stage of development, and is probably not suitable for anyone but its
developers to use.

**If** you’re familiar with [Clojure][clojure], [Python][python] (yes, really), Markdown, **and**
Confluence, **and** you’re comfortable reading the source code thoroughly before usage, **and**
you’re comfortable running the tool from a Clojure [REPL][repl] — then it *might* not be a terrible
idea for you to try using this tool.
