# Run this from the root of the repo.

# This will download libraries, if necessary, then start a REPL.
# It also starts a Clojure socket REPL on port 5555. (If you run into port conflicts, you/we can
# change the port specified in deps.edn to `0` — which means “some available port” — and then use
# `lsof` or some equivalent (e.g. Sloth on MacOS) to discover the port that was chosen.)
